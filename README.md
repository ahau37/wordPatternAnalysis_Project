# wordPatternAnalysis_Project

In this project, we analyzed the pattern of words in multiple texts. These pattern is set to be a way that we can visualize them. A way we did this is by reading through the texts and counting all the words. We counted all the times that words appear and sorted them in a way that shows the top 'n' amount. 'n' being the top words that are repeated in these texts. It contains a full analysis report of words in texts.
